==========

Inline JSHint error highlighting with support for JSX



The vim plugin is based on:
https://github.com/hallettj/jslint.vim
Which is why the top level license is copied from there. Within this repo, there are subprojects that have and retain their own licensing. Most of the JS is a direct copy of the Facebook JS transform stack and jshint itself.


**Installation**

- Install Node.js
- Put this in your `.vimrc`
